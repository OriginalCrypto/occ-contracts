## Diagrams

Diagrams are generated from plain text using [plantuml](http://plantuml.com/). Yes it's a Java JAR, it works, you'll get over it...eventually.


### Quick Start

You'll need Graphviz and a Java runtime in order to run plantuml.

##### Linux (Debian variants)
```
$ sudo apt-get install graphviz
```

##### Mac
For the love of god, install [HomeBrew](https://brew.sh/), then:
```
$ brew install graphviz
```

##### Windows
https://graphviz.gitlab.io/_pages/Download/Download_windows.html



##### *nix (plus Mac)
```
$ ./diagram.sh <file -name>
```

##### Windows
```
> diagram.cmd <file -name>
```
